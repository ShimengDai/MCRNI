This repository provides Python code to compute MCRNI (Model Classification Rank-based Negative Index) for binary classification tasks.
MCRNI is a rank-based performance metric designed to complement traditional evaluation measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC by offering an interpretable, summative assessment of classifier ranking behavior.

The current version supports binary classification. Future updates will extend functionality to multi-class classification.
